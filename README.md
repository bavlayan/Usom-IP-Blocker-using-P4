# Usom IP Blocker using P4

### What is P4? [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P4_(programming_language))
> P4 is a programming language for controlling packet forwarding planes in networking devices, such as routers and switches. In contrast to a general purpose language such as C or Python, P4 is a domain-specific language with a number of constructs optimized for network data forwarding. P4 is distributed as open-source, permissively licensed code, and is maintained by the P4 Language Consortium, a not-for-profit organization hosted by the Open Networking Foundation. 

### The Aim of Project
The aim of Usom IP Blocker project prevents all packets that request from host to blocked urls in topology which pictured below. 

### Topology Structure

## Start Setup

In order to create the topology and simulate it on mininet, the virtual machine with p4 ready installed should be downloaded as ova image and run on VirtualBox.
