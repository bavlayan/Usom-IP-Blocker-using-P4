# Usom IP Blocker using P4

### What is P4? [WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P4_(programming_language))
> P4 is a programming language for controlling packet forwarding planes in networking devices, such as routers and switches. In contrast to a general purpose language such as C or Python, P4 is a domain-specific language with a number of constructs optimized for network data forwarding. P4 is distributed as open-source, permissively licensed code, and is maintained by the P4 Language Consortium, a not-for-profit organization hosted by the Open Networking Foundation.
